Pitch: This app allows school administrators in the developing world to track and broadcast the needs of their school to board members in the US.

MVP: School Admin can login and create, read, update and delete information on the condition of the school including general issues and the condition of equipment devices in the school (TVs, tablets, chromebooks, servers, routers, HDMI cables). A board member can log in and mark the action as done, scheduled, or ignored, and comment with more information.

Stretch:  Payment integration on single issue view page- Implement a payment feature so a donor could see a need and purchase the needed device, HDMI cord, desk, etc.
